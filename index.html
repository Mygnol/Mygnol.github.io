			Long was born in Klang, Malaysia. His interest in programming started as early as 2008, on an online games platform known as <strong>Roblox</strong>. Although he was too young to use the scripting tools to their fullest at the time, the passion to create remained and still remains with him.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now finishing his education at <strong>UOW KDU Glenmarie</strong>, majoring in Game Programming, he is all too aware of how much there is yet to learn...
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>...And is all too willing to give it his best shot.</em>
